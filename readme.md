# Java Exercise: Find Unique Characters

You are given a string containing only lowercase English letters. Your task is to write a Java method that returns a string containing only the unique characters from the input string.

Your method signature should be:

```
public static String uniqueCharacters(String input)
```

The method should return a string containing only the unique characters from the input string. The order of characters in the output string should be the same as their order of appearance in the input string.

For example:

If the input string is "banana", the output string should be "ban".
If the input string is "hello", the output string should be "helo".
If the input string is "world", the output string should be "world".
You should write a program that contains the `uniqueCharacters` method and a main method to test your implementation with different input strings.
